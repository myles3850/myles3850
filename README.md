Hi! Welcome to my playground.

Im a self taught programmer passionate about the data driven world we live in, and its relationship between our physical and digital world.

I love all things open source, and aspire to help build data driven technology that can assist those who need it.

Now you know a bit about me, let me quickly save that response we just got.👨🏽‍💻

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
SET @userId = (INSERT INTO user VALUES (name) return id);

INSERT INTO profile (user_id, languages, location, hobbies) VALUES (@userId, languages, loc, hobbies);
COMMIT;
```
Much better! Now we have that stored, lets se what we just how far we can go. 🛫
