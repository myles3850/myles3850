Hi! Welcome to my playground.

Im a self taught programmer passionate about the data driven world we live in, and its relationship between our physical and digital world.

I love all things open source, and aspire to help build data driven technology that can assist those who need it.

Before i tell you more about me, let me quickly save that response we just got

```sql
SET @userId = (INSERT INTO user VALUES (name) return id);

INSERT INTO profile (user_id, languages, location, hobbies) VALUES (@userId, languages, loc, hobbies);
```
